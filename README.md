## Usage

For a user who is searching for inspiration from an indie app, anyone can make an account, read through and discover quotes that may light a fire in them, and save/unsave those quotes to their portfolio.

## Credits

This project was created by Hunter Shutteworth, Brendan Shelton, Matthew Swineford, and Brayden Burleigh. Bootstrap and Bulma were utilized for some of the CSS as well.

## Future Development Plans

We plan to add a larger database of quotes, perhaps by pulling in an already existing API, as well as include images/paintings/pictures. In the user's portfolio, they may be able to add their own quote to the database as well as save more than one quote for their later viewing. In addition, users will be able to comment on the quotes that they saved. And for responsiveness, better quality sizing when the screen size is smaller.
